From the outset, it was conceived as a **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)** project and as an enhanced successor to the original Tonatiuh ray tracer.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nThe original Tonatiuh code has a long and diverse history. I first developed it under contract with NREL while serving as Director of the Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Brownsville in the United States. When I later returned to Spain and joined CENER\u2014the National Renewable Energy Center\u2014I continued its development while establishing and directing its Solar Thermal Department. After my departure from CENER to direct the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative at CSIRO in Australia, CENER continued leading Tonatiuh\u2019s evolution, a role it still maintains today.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Tonatiuh++ Was Created\\n\\nWhile at the Cyprus Institute, I recognized that the original Tonatiuh had become increasingly difficult to extend without breaking backward compatibility with existing applications. Tonatiuh++ was therefore envisioned as a **clean evolution**, built on the original Tonatiuh code base but modernized without the constraint of preserving compatibility with legacy scripts and documents.\\n\\nDuring the CySTEM project, **Dr. Victor Grigoriev** served as the lead developer. His contributions significantly enhanced both the functionality and computational performance of the software. Unfortunately, CYI was unable to retain Dr. Grigoriev after the project ended, and he subsequently left academia. Combined with personal circumstances that required me to step down as ERA Chair, this led to a period of reduced development activity for Tonatiuh++.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Resuming Development\\n\\nMy recent return to CIEMAT as a Distinguished Researcher, within the framework of the **ATRAE program** of the Spanish State Research Agency, has created the right conditions to resume and lead Tonatiuh++ development. As Principal Investigator of the project *\u201cTowards disruptive innovation in advanced solar energy systems through artificial intelligence and high performance computing,\u201d* I now have both the opportunity and the responsibility to push Tonatiuh++ forward.\\n\\nA foundational objective is to ensure that Tonatiuh++ runs natively on **all major operating systems**. While previous work focused mainly on Windows, my intention is to restore and guarantee full support for:\\n\\n- **Windows 11**\\n- **Linux**\\n- **macOS**\\n\\nAchieving robust cross-platform building and execution is the first decisive step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Short-Term Roadmap\\n\\n### 1. Restore cross-platform build and execution  \\nEnsure Tonatiuh++ can be built cleanly from the source code and run natively on Windows, Linux, and macOS using modern toolchains.\\n\\n### 2. Establish a professional CI/CD workflow  \\nDeploy a GitHub-based continuous integration and continuous development pipeline to automate building, testing, and packaging.\\n\\n### 3. Repair the software update mechanism  \\nThe prior self-update system ceased to function when CYI discontinued the Bitbucket server hosting update metadata. Restoring this capability is a priority.\\n\\n### 4. Provide a professional installer and distribution options  \\nEnable users to choose between building from source or installing precompiled binaries through a reliable installer.\\n\\n### 5. Introduce benchmarking capabilities  \\nDefine appropriate benchmarks to evaluate performance, guide improvements, and quantify software advancements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Target Timeline\\n\\nMy objective is to complete these foundational restoration and infrastructure tasks by **January 2026**, potentially earlier if additional collaborators join the effort.\\n\\nOnce these steps are achieved, the development focus will shift from infrastructure to **innovation**, enabling the introduction of new features and capabilities that will expand the analytical and simulation capabilities of Tonatiuh++.\\n\\n---"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-14-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to the Tonatiuh++ Development Blog","description":"Introduction to the Tonatiuh++ Development Blog - documenting advances in this solar ray tracing software for concentrating solar thermal systems","date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Welcome","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/welcome","description":"Welcome and introductory posts"},{"inline":false,"label":"Tonatiuh","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/tonatiuh","description":"Posts about Tonatiuh++ software development"},{"inline":false,"label":"Solar Energy","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/solar-energy","description":"Solar energy research and developments"},{"inline":false,"label":"Ray Tracing","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/ray-tracing","description":"Ray tracing algorithms and techniques"},{"inline":false,"label":"CST","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/cst","description":"Concentrating Solar Thermal systems"},{"inline":false,"label":"CSP","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/tags/csp","description":"Concentrating Solar Power"}],"readingTime":0.27,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Blanco","title":"TonatiuhXX Developer & CST Researcher","url":"https://github.com/mblancomuriel","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/CST-Modelling-Tools"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/mblancomuriel.png","key":"mblanco","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to the Tonatiuh++ Development Blog","authors":"mblanco","tags":["welcome","tonatiuh","solar-energy","ray-tracing","cst","csp"],"description":"Introduction to the Tonatiuh++ Development Blog - documenting advances in this solar ray tracing software for concentrating solar thermal systems","keywords":["tonatiuh","solar ray tracing","CST","concentrating solar power","optical simulation"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Tonatiuh++ Current Status and Roadmap for Future Development","permalink":"/tonatiuhxx-blog/status-and-future-work"}},"content":"This blog documents the ongoing development and enhancement of Tonatiuh++, an advanced solar ray tracing software for analyzing the optical behaviour of concentrating solar power systems.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## About Tonatiuh++\\n\\nTonatiuh++ is an enhanced version of the Tonatiuh ray tracer with improvements in ray tracing algorithms, performance, and cross-platform support.\\n\\nMore content coming soon!"}]}}')}}]);
