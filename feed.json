            "content_html": "<p>Tonatiuh++ began its development in <strong>2018</strong> within the framework of the <em>CySTEM ERA Chair</em> project at the Cyprus Institute. From the outset, it was conceived as a <strong>Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)</strong> project and as an enhanced successor to the original Tonatiuh ray tracer.</p>\n<p>The original Tonatiuh code has a long and diverse history. I first developed it under contract with NREL while serving as Director of the Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Brownsville in the United States. When I later returned to Spain and joined CENER—the National Renewable Energy Center—I continued its development while establishing and directing its Solar Thermal Department. After my departure from CENER to direct the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative at CSIRO in Australia, CENER continued leading Tonatiuh’s evolution, a role it still maintains today.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"why-tonatiuh-was-created\">Why Tonatiuh++ Was Created<a href=\"https://cst-modelling-tools.github.io/tonatiuhxx-blog/status-and-future-work#why-tonatiuh-was-created\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Tonatiuh++ Was Created\" title=\"Direct link to Why Tonatiuh++ Was Created\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>While at the Cyprus Institute, I recognized that the original Tonatiuh had become increasingly difficult to extend without breaking backward compatibility with existing applications. Tonatiuh++ was therefore envisioned as a <strong>clean evolution</strong>, built on the original Tonatiuh code base but modernized without the constraint of preserving compatibility with legacy scripts and documents.</p>\n<p>During the CySTEM project, <strong>Dr. Victor Grigoriev</strong> served as the lead developer. His contributions significantly enhanced both the functionality and computational performance of the software. Unfortunately, CYI was unable to retain Dr. Grigoriev after the project ended, and he subsequently left academia. Combined with personal circumstances that required me to step down as ERA Chair, this led to a period of reduced development activity for Tonatiuh++.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"resuming-development\">Resuming Development<a href=\"https://cst-modelling-tools.github.io/tonatiuhxx-blog/status-and-future-work#resuming-development\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Resuming Development\" title=\"Direct link to Resuming Development\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>My recent return to CIEMAT as a Distinguished Researcher, within the framework of the <strong>ATRAE program</strong> of the Spanish State Research Agency, has created the right conditions to resume and lead Tonatiuh++ development. As Principal Investigator of the project <em>“Towards disruptive innovation in advanced solar energy systems through artificial intelligence and high performance computing,”</em> I now have both the opportunity and the responsibility to push Tonatiuh++ forward.</p>\n<p>A foundational objective is to ensure that Tonatiuh++ runs natively on <strong>all major operating systems</strong>. While previous work focused mainly on Windows, my intention is to restore and guarantee full support for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"\"><strong>Windows 11</strong></li>\n<li class=\"\"><strong>Linux</strong></li>\n<li class=\"\"><strong>macOS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Achieving robust cross-platform building and execution is the first decisive step.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"short-term-roadmap\">Short-Term Roadmap<a href=\"https://cst-modelling-tools.github.io/tonatiuhxx-blog/status-and-future-work#short-term-roadmap\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Short-Term Roadmap\" title=\"Direct link to Short-Term Roadmap\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"1-restore-cross-platform-build-and-execution\">1.
